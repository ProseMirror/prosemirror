<h2>Demonstration Text</h2>

<p>A ProseMirror document is based on a schema, which determines the
kind of elements that may occur in it, and the relation they have to
each other. This one is based on the basic schema, with lists and
tables added. It allows the usual <strong>strong</strong>
and <em>emphasized</em> text, <code>code font</code>,
and <a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl">links</a>. There are also
images: <img alt="demo picture" src="img.png">.</p>

<p>On the block level you can have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ordered lists (such as this one)</li>
  <li>Bullet lists</li>
  <li>Blockquotes</li>
  <li>Code blocks</li>
  <li>Tables</li>
  <li>Horizontal rules</li>
</ol>

<p>It isn't hard to define your own custom elements, and include them
in your schema. These can be opaque 'leaf' nodes, that the user
manipulates through extra interfaces you provide, or nodes with
regular editable child nodes.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Model</h2>

<p>Nodes can nest arbitrarily deep. Thus, the document forms a tree,
not dissimilar to the browser's DOM tree.</p>

<p>At the inline level, the model works differently. Each block of
text is a single node containing a flat series of inline elements.
These are serialized as a tree structure when outputting HTML.</p>

<p>Positions in the document are represented as a path (an array of
offsets) through the block tree, and then an offset into the inline
content of the block. Blocks that have no inline content (such as
horizontal rules and HTML blocks) can not have the cursor inside of
them. User-exposed operations on the document preserve the invariant
that there is always at least a single valid cursor position.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>We did not see a nested blockquote
yet.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<pre><code class="lang-markdown">Nor did we see a code block

Note that the content of a code block can't be styled.</code></pre>

<p>This paragraph has<br>a hard break inside of it.</p>
