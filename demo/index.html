<h2>Demonstration Text</h2>

<p>In a ProseMirror document, you can have the
usual <strong>strong</strong> and <em>emphasized</em> text, <code>code
font</code>, and <a href="http://marijnhaverbeke.nl">links</a>. There
are also images: <img alt="demo picture" src="img.png">.</p>

<p>On the block level you can have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ordered lists (such as this one)</li>
  <li>Bullet lists</li>
  <li>Blockquotes</li>
  <li>Code blocks</li>
  <li>Horizontal rules</li>
</ol>

<p>That is about it, though you can also bind extra commands and menu
items that insert custom raw HTML blocks. These are not editable
inside the editor, only though site-defined interface elements.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Interface</h2>

<p>The current interface will show a widget for inline styling when
you select a piece of text. It will keep a “hamburger button” floating
to the right of the currently focused block, though which you can
manipulate block-level structure.</p>

<p>There are also a number of keys bound to commands, which can be
customized. Here are a few examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Ctrl-B</code> and <code>Ctrl-I</code> for strong and emphasized</li>
  <li><code>Alt-Left</code> to dedent a block</li>
  <li><code>Alt-Up</code> to join it to a similar block above it</li>
  <li><p><code>Alt-Right</code> plus a second keypress to wrap a block</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“*” for bullet list</li>
      <li>“1” for numbered list</li>
      <li>“>” for blockquote</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-Enter</code> to insert a hard break</li>
  <li><code>Ctrl-Z</code> and <code>Ctrl-Y</code> to un- and redo</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally, there is support for defining “input rules” where some
types of typed input cause something to happen. This demo has
automatic quotes enabled, so that when you type single or double
quotes in a non-code context, they'll be converted to the appropriate
Unicode quote, and allows you to start a list or a quote by typing
“>”, “*”, or “1.”, followed by a space, at the start of a
paragraph.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Model</h2>

<p>Blockquotes and lists can nest arbitrarily deep. Thus, the document
forms a tree, not dissimilar to the browser's DOM tree.</p>

<p>At the inline level, the model works differently. Each block of
text is a single node containing a flat series of inline elements.
These are serialized as a tree structure when outputting HTML.</p>

<p>Positions in the document are represented as a path (an array of
offsets) through the block tree, and then an offset into the inline
content of the block. Blocks that have no inline content (such as
horizontal rules and HTML blocks) can not have the cursor inside of
them. User-exposed operations on the document preserve the invariant
that there is always at least a single valid cursor position.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<blockquote><blockquote><p>We did not see a nested blockquote
yet.</p></blockquote></blockquote>

<pre><code class="lang-markdown">Nor did we see a code block

Note that the content of a code block can't be styled.</code></pre>

<p>This paragraph has<br>a hard break inside of it.</p>
